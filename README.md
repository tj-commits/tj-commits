Please check out <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-npm-ai/lolite">Lolite</a>, and read some of the source code. Specifically, read the source code for `lolite.identity`, `lolite.isBoolean`, and `lolite.isNumber`. You'll laugh really hard. Please leave a star. I put lots of effort into this kind of useless thing. Btw i'm 11 years old
