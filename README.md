[PLEASE CHECK OUT LOLITE ON MY 10XLY GITHUB ORG JUST READ ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS' SOURCE CODE UNDER SRC/LIB YOU WILL LAUGH I GUARANTEE IT](https://github.com/10xly/lolite/tree/main/src/lib)

## 🛠️ What I do
- **[10x'ly Made](https://github.com/10xly)** - I have 700+ overengineered joke npm packages that use as many dependencies as possible, inspired by OGs like [is-thirteen](https://github.com/jezen/is-thirteen) and [is-ten-thousand](https://github.com/james-work-account/is-then-thousand)
- **[VSCode Material Icon Theme](https://github.com/material-extensions/vscode-material-icon-theme/pull/2218)**: I designed the TV, Desktop, and Console folder icons. So you've probably seen icons I've designed.
- **Content**: I make chess videos on YouTube and release songs under Fox Jones.
- I also contribute to big open-source projects sometimes.
